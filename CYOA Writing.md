## Personal characteristics:

### What race are you?

1. Humans, the most populous sentient race on Inkhora. They are not especially good or bad at anything, but their versatility has allowed them to prosper. They can be found everywhere but on the shores of Monstadt.
2. Dwarves, a stout and passionate race. They value tradition and brotherhood. They're more common in the north of the Republic and Feuding Clans Territory.
3. Elves, a magical and graceful race. They are united by a love nature, magic, and artistry. They're most common in the Austere Empire and throughout Rizeli.
4. Gnomes, an inventive and curious race. They're often enthusiastic about their work and construct fantastic homes. Tight communities of them usually live together separate from the rest of a town.
5. Halflings, a small and friendly race. They are fond of quiet, out-of-the-way places to make their homes, and they're fiercely protective of their friends. They can be found in quiet places all over.
6. Other races are less common and draw reactions ranging from curiosity (hybrids, Goliaths, Dragonborn) to disbelief (Tieflings, Warforged). Be prepared to hide or draw attention.

### Languages: largely ignore canon d&d

1. Riven, the language of Rive. It has changed over the millennia, but in the present, it is pronounced with long syllables and low vowels. A language understood by many even out of its home country, it would not be too surprising to speak it in most places.
    * Tung script
2. Austere, the language of the Empire. It is a language of shifting tones and subtle nuances. It can sound oddly regal with a steady voice, even if you can’t understand what is being said. Very few outside of the Empire speak it, so it is likely to sound exotic anywhere you go.
    - Kala Glyphs
3. Bong, the common language of the Croft Republic. It’s a highly inflective language, and its words can get long, but it doesn’t require difficult pronunciations and is relatively easy to learn. It’s common East of Eruditia, especially in the Republic and Feuding Clan Territory.
    - Eshta
4. A Croft family language, a remnant from before the Republic, when the land was still divided. Although the people here use Bong as a common language, they still have their pride. Your family language can be whatever you want it to be, within reason.
    - Eshta / Elian
5. A feuding clan’s language, usually highly influenced by the Austere or the Croft family languages. Although the people here use Bong as a common language, they still have secrets to keep. Your clan’s language can be whatever you want it to be, within reason.
  - Eshta / Elian
6. Mondri, the most widely spoken language in the world. It’s a terrible amalgamation of Erudite, Old Reverian, and Riven, but it’s natively spoken by millions across the nations of Reverie, Mondra, Eruditia, and Rizeli. Even outside of that, it would not be uncommon.
  - Scythian
   7. Old Reverian, the ancient language of the kingdom of Reverie. It is seldom spoken except for in prayer in the Church of Reverie, and mostly written in the ancient records in the Church’s vault. Clergymen, scholars, and philosophers are the most likely to know this.
       - Scythian
8. Erudite, the ancient language of Eruditia. It sounds clear and unambiguous in its pronunciation, and has both syllable stress and length. It is still learned by all of its citizens, along with Mondri. Outside of that, only the most dedicated foreign scholars know it.
    - Lierean
9. Rizelian, the common language of Rizeli. Before the Rizelian Empire, various dialects already existed, but one is now the official language. It is commonly spoken in Rizeli and Peddler’s Isle, but it’s more likely to be recognized than understood in foreign lands.
    - Scythian
10. A Rizelian family dialect, similar to a Croft family language, is a symbol of pride for the once divided people of Rizeli. They mostly sound similar to Rizelian, but aren’t all mutually intelligible. Yours can be whatever you want it to be, within reason.
    - Scythian
11. Sylvan, the obscure unwritten language of nature, spoken by some magical creatures and nature spirits. It can sound very different depending on the speaker, but it generally flows smoothly and sounds pleasant. It is exceedingly rare outside of Monstadt.
12. Druidic, the secret language of Druids. To the uninitiated, it sounds guttural and primitive, and its writing appears as strange shapes, swirls, lines, and symbols. It is impossible to learn, understand, or speak directly by using mortal magic.
     - Evion
